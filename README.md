# Rock-Paper-Scissor
Welcome to my simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game! This project is a fun implementation of the classic game using JavaScript prompts. Simply run the script in your browser's console and follow the prompts to play against the computer. It's a great way to pass the time and test your luck. Enjoy!

Updated Version:

The new version has UI in which players press the buttons instead of 
entering the text for choices. The new version shows the choices of both
computer and human as images. Both players now have 11 health bars, first 
to lose all health loses!! and the other player wins the game!!. In this version new rule is added that is if its a tie both players will lose 1 health bar.

Hope you will enjoy it.
Have fun.
Thank You.
